## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
    One thing that resonated with me was the idea that a Super Learner is just a person who has adopted healthy learning habits, not necessary a naturally gifted person. In other words, it's something we can all improve. The growth mindset is something I am always working on. I've been in very competitive environments where the only thing that matters is the end result, and I really have to remember that the growth and the process are more important. I already do my best to read as much as I can, take care of my brain, and take breaks, but there's always room for improvement on these. The one thing I would add is exercise, which is also so important to keeping your brain healthy. If I don't move my body regularly, I end up feeling foggy and definitely not in a good place to learn anything.
2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
    - Number: This data type includes integers (including negative integers) and decimals.
    - String: Strings are characters enclosed in quotation marks. They can be numbers, letters, special characters, or even emojis.
    - Boolean: Equivalent to a yes/no or true/false question. E.g., *4 >= 4* asks the question is 4 greater than or equal to 4? In English the answer is **yes**, a Boolean will output **true**.
3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
    `console.log("Hello World!");`
4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
    Code comments are bits of human language inserted into code for the purpose of communicating with the programmer rather than the computer. They can have multiple functions, most commonly explaining the function of a piece of code, which is easier for a human to understand in plain language rather than sifting through the actual code. Since the computer skips over any text indicated as a comment with the below characters, comments can also be used to hide incomplete pieces of code from the computer.
      - /* *comment here* */ can be used for a multi-line comment
      - // *comment here* can be used for a single-line comment
5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
    A variable is like your cereal bowl. When you get it out and put it on the table, you know you have a place waiting for your cereal, but you don't know yet what kind of cereal you will have. Then you can put whatever kind of cereal in it you want, Cheerios, Kix, Froot Loops. And  you don't always have to fill it with the same type of cereal, it can be Kix one day and Cheerios the next. The bowl is just the place where the cereal goes, and a variable is where a piece of information goes.
6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
    Thinking of my amazon home page,
    1. there is a delivery location which fills in my city and zip code. Although the zip code is a number, it's likely part of the string that includes the city name.
    2. the site greets me with "Hello, Anna", and my name is probably a variable of type string.
    3. in the Cart icon, there's a little red number that changes based on how many items I have in my cart. That would be a number variable.
7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
    Concatenation puts things together. It's grabbing multiple inputs and stringing them together like the cars on a train. In JavaScript, we do this using (+), e.g. `console.log("Hello " + name + ", how are you on this " + dayOfWeek + "?");` where "name" and "dayOfWeek" are previously defined variables.
8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
    I play online scrabble on Lexulous.com, and the home page always greets me with a word for hello in a different language plus my username (e.g., "Ciao, AnnaK!"). These two items change frequently, I would guess variables are concatenated to output that string.
9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
    1. If a number can be included in a string, why is it necessary to have a separate data type for numbers?
    2. Are there resources to help with practicing keyboard commands? I'm not always sure what fingers I should use for those out of the way keys, and I'd like to build my skills in an efficient way.
