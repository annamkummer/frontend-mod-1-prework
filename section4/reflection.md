## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
  * I had already been using the Pomodoro Technique, so it didn't feel very different. However, writing down the Step 1s really highlighted that I do not have a good idea of wheat I can accomplish in a 25 minute period. I have a better idea of what I can get done in a 2 or 4 hour period, but learning to break things down better could help with efficiency going forward.
1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
  * As I mentioned above, the time estimates were off. This also meant that I wasn't always sticking to what I said I would do. If I finish a task in 10 minutes, I have a hard time saying I'm going to rework and review it for another 15 just because that's what I said I would do for this 25 minute period. So, I prefer to allow myself to be more flexible. I also find that if I don't allow time to check email, slack, and my calendar for the day, I have a hard time staying focused at the beginning of the day. So, I need to build in time to do that review first so my brain is free to focus on the current task.
1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
  * Like an array, an object is also a variable containing a collection of data. However, objects contain key-value pairs that store information about the object, which can be called later, whereas elements in an array can only be called by index number.
1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
      * Array, because this only needs a list without any information about the individual items.
  * List of states and their capitals
      * Object, because there are multiple data points for each item.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
      * Array, because this only needs a list without any information about the individual items.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
      * Array, because this only needs a list without any information about the individual items.
  * List of student names and their cohort
      * Object, because there are multiple data points for each item.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake      
      * Object, because there are multiple data points for each item.
  * All my favorite restaurants
      * Array, because this only needs a list without any information about the individual items.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
    * On amazon, each item for sale could be an object. The key-value pairs would be things like the title (e.g., "HEPA filter"), image, seller (e.g., "Amazon"), price (e.g., 39.99), whether it's prime eligible (true or false to check a box), and estimated delivery date (e.g., "Monday, July 19th").

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
    1. Is it possible to add properties to a class after the initial declaration? Or to just one object instance, not all?
    2. I'm not quite following hoe the `new` keyword can call the `constructor` method.
