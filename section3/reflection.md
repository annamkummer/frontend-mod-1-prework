## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
    1. That programming is a great way to develop the growth mindset, in particular through receiving constructive feedback and learning to accept mistakes and fix them.
    2. Comparison is useful, but only to yourself, not others. When you feel stupid or get stuck, it can be useful to look back at where you started and note your progress. But because everyone learns at their own pace, comparisons to others are not helpful.
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
    I demonstrate a growth mindset in my constant willingness to learn. Of course that applies to learning to code now, but another example is how I'm working on my Farsi, as well. One growth mindset idea I could definitely work on is not comparing myself to others. I often use others as a measure of my success, and I need to focus more instead on viewing my own progress.
1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
    On amazon.com, your purchased items could be saved in an array to be displayed on the Buy Again page. Each time you make a purchase, the array could be updated with the new item. Then when you navigate to the Buy Again page, it would just pull up the array and display all items on the list.
1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
    An array method is a way of interacting with an array using a function tacked on to the end of the array name, after (.).
1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
    The purpose of a loop is to repeat a task without having to manually rewrite the code for each iteration. If it just needs to perform exactly the same task each time, a loop can be used without an array. If it needs to perform a function on a set of items, then a loop can be used in conjunction with an array. In that case, each iteration of the loop will run on one item in the array.
1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
    A loop is repeating the same activity over and over, like taking turns in a game. Think of playing Candy Land with your friends. On each person's turn, they pick a card and move their character along the board, and then it's the next person's turn. Each person does the same thing, picking a card, moving their character, moving on to the next person. This goes on an on as long as no one reaches the Candy Castle. When someone's character does land on the Candy Castle, then the game is over, and no more turns are taken.
1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
    1. Is there a practical limit to the number of elements in a array?
    2. Can you run a loop indefinitely if it resets itself somehow? Or will an un-ending loop always crash?
